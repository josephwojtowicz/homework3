# homework3

In this repo is my project for homework #3, a random password generator. 

For this project, we were given HTML and CSS that produced a functioning website, 
but a JavaScript file which was incomplete.

I created variables and arrays of the characters which would be used in the generated
password, and also built a function which would generate the password based on a 
number choice between 8 and 128 characters, as well as four critera, uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 

In the prompts subsequent to the number choice you input, clicking "OK" will input that 
critera into your password, and clicking "Cancel" will not include it in your generated
password.
